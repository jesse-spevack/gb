## Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

All tasks have been successfully implemented for the Assignment Processing Status View feature.

## Relevant Files

- `app/views/assignments/show.html.erb` - Main assignment view that displays the processing status
- `app/controllers/assignments_controller.rb` - Controller that handles assignment display and updates
- `app/views/assignments/_progress_card.html.erb` - Partial for overall progress display
- `app/views/assignments/_student_work_row.html.erb` - Partial for individual student work status
- `app/views/assignments/_rubric_section.html.erb` - Partial for displaying rubric content
- `app/views/assignments/_tab_indicator.html.erb` - Partial for phase status indicators
- `app/javascript/controllers/assignment_progress_controller.js` - Stimulus controller for progress animations
- `app/services/broadcast_service.rb` - Service for TurboStream broadcasts
- `app/services/assignments/progress_calculator.rb` - Existing service for progress calculation
- `test/controllers/assignments_controller_test.rb` - Tests for controller updates
- `test/system/assignment_processing_status_test.rb` - System tests for real-time updates
- `test/services/broadcast_service_test.rb` - Tests for broadcast functionality

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `my_class.rb` and `my_class_test.rb` in the `test` directory).
- Use `bin/rails test [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests.

## Implementation plan

### Task 0.1
Assess the current assignment show view (`app/views/assignments/show.html.erb`) and related components. Document what exists, what can be reused, and what needs to be modified or created. 

**Assessment completed:**

**Existing Components Found:**
1. **Main view** (`app/views/assignments/show.html.erb`):
   - Has a basic progress tracking card (lines 14-63) showing static completion metrics
   - Navigation tabs for sections (details, rubric, student_works, summary)
   - Content sections that switch based on active_section param
   - Uses @progress_metrics from controller's calculate_progress_metrics method

2. **Progress Card Partial** (`app/views/assignments/_progress_card.html.erb`):
   - Already exists with live update capability via TurboStream
   - Has overall percentage display, progress bar, and phase indicators
   - Includes ETA calculation using TimeEstimator service
   - Has proper DOM ID for turbo updates: `assignment_#{id}_progress`
   - Displays all three phases with animated spinners for in-progress states

3. **Student Work Row Partial** (`app/views/assignments/_student_work_row.html.erb`):
   - Already exists with proper DOM ID: `student_work_#{id}`
   - Shows pending/processing/complete states
   - Note: Uses `processing_started_at` field that doesn't exist in schema

4. **Rubric Section Partial** (`app/views/assignments/_rubric_section.html.erb`):
   - Already exists with DOM ID: `rubric_content`
   - Shows loading spinner when rubric is nil
   - Displays rubric criteria when complete

5. **Tab Indicator Partial** (`app/views/assignments/_tab_indicator.html.erb`):
   - Simple partial for showing green/gray dots

6. **Supporting Infrastructure**:
   - `AssignmentsController#show` loads all necessary data
   - `Assignments::ProgressCalculator` service provides detailed progress metrics
   - `BroadcastService` already has methods for broadcasting updates
   - `AssignmentsHelper` has status_badge helpers

**Key Findings:**
- Most required partials and infrastructure already exist!
- The progress_card partial is already sophisticated with real-time updates
- Main issue: The show view is using a simpler progress display instead of the advanced progress_card partial
- Student work row references `processing_started_at` field that needs to be added
- BroadcastService already has most broadcast logic implemented

**Work Needed:**
1. Replace the basic progress card in show.html.erb with the advanced progress_card partial
2. Add TurboStream connection to the show view
3. Add `processing_started_at` field to StudentWork model
4. Ensure broadcasts are triggered during processing
5. Add better handling for currently processing student work display
6. Enhance mobile responsiveness

### Task 1.1
Update assignment show controller action to check processing status and prepare necessary instance variables for the view. Ensure the controller loads assignment, rubric, student works, and progress data. Add logic to determine if processing is ongoing or complete.

### Task 1.2
Create the main structure in `app/views/assignments/show.html.erb` with sections for progress display, phase indicators, rubric content, student work list, and assignment summary. Use semantic HTML and set up the basic layout structure that will be populated by partials.

### Task 1.3
Create `app/views/assignments/_progress_card.html.erb` partial that displays the overall progress bar (0-100%), ETA display with time remaining, and current processing phase. Include DOM ID `assignment_#{id}_progress` for TurboStream updates.

### Task 1.4
Create `app/views/assignments/_tab_indicator.html.erb` partial that shows the three processing phases (Rubric Generation, Student Work Processing, Assignment Summary) with visual status indicators (pending/in_progress/completed). Include appropriate DOM IDs like `rubric_tab_indicator` and `summary_tab_indicator`.

### Task 2.1
Create `app/views/assignments/_student_work_row.html.erb` partial that displays individual student work with status indicators (pending gray, processing spinner, completed checkmark, failed X). Include student name, status icon, and error message if applicable. Use DOM ID `student_work_#{id}`.

### Task 2.2
Create `app/views/assignments/_rubric_section.html.erb` partial that displays the completed rubric criteria list (titles only) with a "View full rubric" link. Include green completion indicator and use DOM ID `rubric_content` for updates.

### Task 2.3
Integrate the existing `Assignments::ProgressCalculator` service into the view. Update the controller to use this service and pass progress data to the view. Ensure percentage calculations are accurate for each phase.

### Task 2.4
Create `app/javascript/controllers/assignment_progress_controller.js` Stimulus controller to handle smooth progress bar animations, fade-in effects for completed items, and spinning indicators. Ensure no jarring layout shifts during updates.

### Task 3.1
Define and document all TurboStream broadcast target DOM IDs in the view files. Ensure consistent naming: `assignment_#{id}_progress`, `student_work_#{id}`, `rubric_content`, `rubric_tab_indicator`, `summary_tab_indicator`. Add data attributes for Turbo targeting.

### Task 3.2
Update `app/services/broadcast_service.rb` to support assignment progress broadcasts. Add methods for broadcasting overall progress updates and phase changes. Ensure broadcasts include the correct turbo_stream targets.

### Task 3.3
Implement broadcast logic in the rubric generation pipeline to send TurboStream update when rubric completes. Update the view to show "Creating rubric..." before processing and display rubric content after completion with green indicator.

### Task 3.4
Implement broadcast logic for each student work as it processes. Send updates for status changes (pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed/failed). Include current count "Generating student feedback (X of Y)" in broadcasts.

### Task 3.5
Implement broadcast logic for assignment summary phase. Send broadcast showing "Creating assignment summary..." when starting and update with green completion indicator when finished.

### Task 4.1
Create error display components using Tailwind classes for inline error messages. Design red indicators with clear error text for failed processing steps. Ensure errors are visually distinct but not alarming.

### Task 4.2
Implement logic in the assignment processor to continue processing remaining student works even if individual items fail. Update the progress calculator to account for failures in percentage calculations. Ensure failed items don't block overall completion.

### Task 4.3
Add JavaScript fallback handling for when TurboStream connections fail. Implement periodic polling as backup, display connection status indicators, and provide manual refresh option if needed.

### Task 4.4
Write comprehensive system tests in `test/system/assignment_processing_status_test.rb` covering rubric generation failure, individual student work failures, connection interruptions, and recovery scenarios. Use Capybara to verify UI updates correctly.

### Task 5.1
Apply Tailwind responsive classes throughout all partials using breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:). Adjust spacing, font sizes, and layout grids for different screen sizes. Ensure consistent spacing scale usage.

### Task 5.2
Review all buttons, links, and interactive elements to ensure minimum 44x44px touch targets on mobile. Add appropriate padding and adjust Tailwind classes. Test with device emulators to verify accessibility.

### Task 5.3
Implement mobile-specific features like collapsible completed sections using Stimulus, priority information at top of mobile view, and simplified progress indicators for small screens. Consider using Tailwind's container queries if applicable.

### Task 5.4
Conduct thorough testing on various devices including iOS Safari, Android Chrome, tablets in both orientations, and desktop browsers. Document any device-specific issues and apply fixes. Verify TurboStream updates work consistently across platforms.
