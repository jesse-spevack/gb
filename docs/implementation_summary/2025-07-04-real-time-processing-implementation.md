# Real-Time Assignment Processing Implementation Summary

*Session Date: July 4, 2025*

## What We Built

We successfully implemented a real-time assignment processing system that replaces hard-coded JavaScript timers with actual backend state tracking and live updates via Turbo Streams.

## Key Features Implemented

### âœ… Core Infrastructure
- **ProcessingStep Model**: Tracks 4 processing stages with status (pending/in_progress/completed)
- **Real-time Updates**: Turbo Streams broadcast step changes to browser during background processing
- **State Persistence**: Processing state survives page refreshes, browser close/reopen
- **Seamless Transition**: Automatically switches from processing view to assignment content when complete

### âœ… User Experience
- **Beautiful Spinner**: Upgraded from simple border spinner to polished blue circular spinner
- **Step Progress**: Visual progress through 4 stages with animations
- **Status Messages**: Dynamic messages showing current processing stage
- **Clean Content View**: Simplified assignment results (no complex tabs)

## Technical Architecture

### Data Model
```ruby
# ProcessingStep model
- assignment_id (belongs_to)
- step_key (string) - 'assignment_saved', 'creating_rubric', 'generating_feedback', 'summarizing_feedback'
- status (enum) - pending: 0, in_progress: 1, completed: 2
- started_at, completed_at (datetime)
```

### Key Files Created/Modified

#### New Files
- `app/models/processing_step.rb` - Core model
- `app/services/processing_step/creation_service.rb` - Creates steps for new assignments
- `app/presenters/processing_step_presenter.rb` - Moves view logic out of templates
- `app/views/assignments/_processing_steps.html.erb` - Processing UI partial
- `app/views/assignments/_assignment_content.html.erb` - Final results view
- `app/views/shared/_spinner.html.erb` - Reusable spinner component
- `lib/tasks/processing_steps.rake` - Backfill task for existing assignments
- `db/migrate/20250704215505_create_processing_steps.rb` - Database schema

#### Modified Files
- `app/services/assignment_processor.rb` - Added step tracking and broadcasting
- `app/services/assignments/creation_service.rb` - Creates processing steps on assignment creation
- `app/models/assignment.rb` - Added has_many :processing_steps association
- `app/views/assignments/show.html.erb` - Conditional rendering based on completion status
- `app/javascript/controllers/assignment_processor_controller.js` - Simplified to work with Turbo Streams
- `config/cable.yml` - Updated to use solid_cable in development for cross-process communication
- `config/database.yml` - Added cable database configuration for development

### Real-Time Flow

1. **Assignment Creation**:
   ```ruby
   # Creates 4 ProcessingStep records (all pending)
   ProcessingStep::CreationService.create(assignment: assignment)
   ```

2. **Background Processing** (AssignmentProcessor):
   ```ruby
   # Each major stage updates steps and broadcasts
   update_processing_step(step_key: "assignment_saved", status: "completed")
   update_processing_step(step_key: "creating_rubric", status: "in_progress")
   # ... continues through all 4 steps
   ```

3. **Turbo Stream Broadcasting**:
   ```ruby
   # During processing - broadcasts processing steps UI
   Turbo::StreamsChannel.broadcast_replace_to(
     "assignment_#{assignment.id}_steps",
     target: "assignment-processing-steps",
     partial: "assignments/processing_steps"
   )
   
   # When complete - broadcasts assignment content
   if assignment.processing_steps.reload.all?(&:completed?)
     Turbo::StreamsChannel.broadcast_replace_to(
       "assignment_#{assignment.id}_steps", 
       target: "assignment-content-container",
       partial: "assignments/assignment_content"
     )
   ```

4. **Frontend Updates**: Turbo automatically updates DOM, Stimulus controller logs changes

## Configuration Requirements

### Development Environment
```yaml
# config/cable.yml
development:
  adapter: solid_cable
  connects_to:
    database:
      writing: cable
  polling_interval: 0.5.seconds

# config/database.yml  
development:
  cable:
    <<: *default
    database: storage/development_cable.sqlite3
    migrations_paths: db/cable_migrate
```

### Process Management
```bash
# Procfile.dev ensures both web and worker processes
web: bin/rails server
css: bin/rails tailwindcss:watch  
worker: bundle exec rake solid_queue:start
```

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- Real-time step tracking and broadcasting
- Beautiful processing UI with spinner
- Simplified assignment content view
- Seamless transition from processing to results
- State persistence across sessions
- Backfill task for existing assignments

### ðŸ”§ Recent Bug Fix
**Issue**: Seamless transition wasn't working
**Root Cause**: `assignment.processing_steps.all?(&:completed?)` was using cached association data
**Fix**: Added `.reload` to get fresh data: `assignment.processing_steps.reload.all?(&:completed?)`

### ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks (Low Priority)
- Clean up old artifacts (ProgressCalculator, ProgressBroadcastService)
- Remove StatusManagerFactory and update_status calls
- These can be done later as they don't affect functionality

## Testing Instructions

1. **Setup**:
   ```bash
   bin/rails processing_steps:backfill  # For existing assignments
   bin/dev  # Starts web + worker processes
   ```

2. **Test Flow**:
   - Create new assignment
   - Watch real-time step progression
   - See automatic transition to assignment content when complete
   - Test page refresh during processing (should show correct state)

## Key Learning: Action Cable + Background Jobs

The critical insight was that Solid Cable in development enables cross-process Action Cable communication. Without this, job-triggered UI updates won't reach the browser since Solid Queue workers run in separate processes from the web server.

## Success Metrics Achieved

âœ… UI accurately reflects backend processing state  
âœ… State persists across page refreshes  
âœ… No regression in visual polish or user experience  
âœ… Clean, maintainable code following Rails conventions  
âœ… Extensible design for future enhancements  

The implementation successfully delivers on the goals of simplicity, functionality, and craft.
