# Student Work Detail Page PRD

**Date:** January 7, 2025  
**Feature:** Student Work Detail Page  
**Status:** Draft  

## Introduction/Overview

The Student Work Detail Page is a comprehensive interface that allows teachers to review and understand student performance on text-based assignments. This page provides detailed assessment information, feedback, and rubric evaluation in a unified view, enabling teachers to make informed decisions about student work and provide meaningful feedback.

The current student work review process lacks sufficient detail and clarity for teachers to effectively assess student performance. This new page consolidates all assessment information into a single, intuitive interface that supports the teacher's workflow from review to feedback delivery.

## Goals

1. **Provide comprehensive assessment visibility** - Teachers can view all assessment details (rubric scores, feedback, integrity checks) in one consolidated view
2. **Improve teacher efficiency** - Reduce time spent navigating between different views to understand student performance
3. **Support informed feedback decisions** - Present clear visual indicators of student achievement levels across all criteria
4. **Enable streamlined feedback delivery** - Provide a clear path from assessment review to student feedback sharing
5. **Accelerate product viability** - Deliver a functional interface that moves the product closer to user-ready state

## User Stories

**As a teacher reviewing student work, I want to:**
- See an overview of student performance at a glance so I can quickly assess overall achievement
- View detailed rubric assessment with visual indicators so I can understand performance across all criteria
- See specific evidence and feedback for each criterion so I can understand the reasoning behind assessments
- Access academic integrity check results so I can verify work authenticity
- Navigate back to the assignment and rubric easily so I can reference original requirements
- Share feedback with the student when I'm ready so they can receive their assessment

**As a teacher using mobile devices, I want to:**
- Review student work on my tablet or phone so I can provide feedback anywhere
- Have the same functionality available on mobile as on desktop so my workflow isn't interrupted

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Historical data display** - Previous submissions or feedback history will not be shown
- **Real-time collaboration** - Multiple teachers simultaneously editing is not supported (handled elsewhere)
- **Grade assignment** - This page is for feedback review only, not grade entry
- **Assignment types beyond text** - Only text-based assignments are supported
- **External integrations** - No LMS, gradebook, or other system integrations
- **Advanced mobile gestures** - Basic responsive design only, no swipe actions or mobile-specific interactions
- **Performance optimization** - No specific performance requirements beyond standard page load
- **Data filtering or search** - All available data is displayed without filtering options
- **Editable feedback** - Teachers cannot modify feedback directly from this view

## Design Considerations

- **Design system compliance** - Must follow existing design system patterns established in DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
- **Color scheme** - Use established color coding: green (Exceeds), blue (Meets), amber (Approaching), red (Below)
- **Typography** - Follow existing typography patterns with proper hierarchy
- **Spacing** - Use consistent spacing patterns from the design system
- **Icons** - Use appropriate icons from the existing icon library
- **Responsive breakpoints** - Support standard breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Reference implementation** - ui_unified.html provides the complete visual specification

## Technical Considerations

- **Rails integration** - Must integrate with existing Rails application architecture
- **Data models** - Must work with StudentWork, StudentWorkCheck, StudentCriterionLevel, and FeedbackItem models
- **Routing** - Must integrate with existing Rails routing patterns
- **Template structure** - Follow existing ERB template conventions
- **CSS framework** - Use Tailwind CSS classes consistent with existing implementation
- **Turbo integration** - Must work with existing Turbo Streams implementation for real-time updates
- **Mobile compatibility** - Must render properly on iOS and Android devices

## Success Metrics

- **Implementation completion** - Page successfully displays all required sections and data
- **Responsive functionality** - Page works effectively on mobile devices and tablets
- **Teacher usability** - Teachers can successfully navigate and understand student performance
- **Product progression** - Feature moves the product closer to user-ready state
- **Design consistency** - Page follows established design system patterns

## Open Questions

- **Loading states** - How should the page handle loading states for different data sections?
- **Error handling** - What should be displayed if specific data is temporarily unavailable?
- **Performance thresholds** - What constitutes acceptable performance for academic integrity percentages?
- **Mobile optimization** - Are there specific mobile interactions that would enhance the teacher experience?

## Implementation Notes

- The complete visual specification is available in `/ui_iterations/ui_unified.html`
- This page will be implemented as `app/views/student_works/show.html.erb`
- Integration with existing assignment show page real-time updates is already handled
- Share functionality will be implemented in a future iteration
