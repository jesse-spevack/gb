# Task 55 Implementation Plan

I need a detailed implementation plan for task 55. Please read `/Users/jesse/code/gb/tasks/tasks.json` to understand the specific requirements, then review the project structure and existing code.

## Required deliverables
- Architecture changes needed
- Files to modify/create
- Implementation order
- Testing approach

## Project context files to review
- `/Users/jesse/code/gb/docs/plan.md` - overall project direction
- `/.cursor/rules` and `/.windsurf/rules` - coding standards
- Browse `/Users/jesse/code/gb` to understand current architecture

## My coding preferences
- Functions that do one thing well
- Self-documenting code (no comments needed)
- Easy to test and maintain
- Follow existing codebase patterns

## Communication style
- Be direct and concise
- Ask clarifying questions
- Push back if you disagree

After reviewing the files, list any questions you need answered before creating the implementation plan.
