## About

### Problem & Purpose

GradeBot is an AI-feedback assistant designed for educators who want to provide better feedback in less time. Grading student work is time-consuming work often done outside of regular school hours. GradeBot helps teachers focus on planning and insights and transform hours of grading into minutes of strategic review.

### Target User

The target user is a teacher who has students complete written assignments using Google Docs. This user may already use LLMs to generate assignments, rubrics, and provide feedback, but the process is time-consuming and manual.

### How It Works

1. **Assignment Creation**: Teachers create a new assignment by entering title, subject, grade level, and instructions.

2. **Rubric Generation**: Teachers can either have GradeBot generate a rubric using AI or paste an existing rubric. 

3. **Student Work Selection**: Teachers click on a Google-branded "Select student work" button that opens a Google Picker. They can select up to 35 pieces of student work.

4. **Feedback Style**: Teachers can customize grading settings by selecting a feedback tone: encouraging, neutral/objective, or critical.

5. **Automated Processing**: After submission, GradeBot:
   - Generates a structured rubric with criteria and levels
   - Processes each student work against the rubric
   - Creates detailed feedback for each student
   - Generates an assignment summary with class-wide insights

6. **Teacher Review**: Teachers can review, edit, and append any feedback to the original Google Doc.

### Subscription Model

- **Free Tier**: 1 assignment per month
- **Paid Tier**: Up to 300 assignments per month for $X.99
- Stripe integration for billing
- Redirects when limits are reached

## Engineering Specification

### Tech Stack

- Rails 8+ with Stimulus for JavaScript
- Tailwind 4+ for styling
- SQLite database
- Solid cache, queue, and cable
- Kamal deployment to Google Cloud Platform
- Kamal Secrets with 1Password adapter for secrets management
- Minitest for testing with fixtures
- Google Docs integration using `drive.file` scope

### Authentication Feature

GradeBot implements a secure, session-based authentication system using Google OAuth2.

#### Database Models

**User Model**
- Has many assignments
- Stores basic user information (name, email, Google UID)

**Session Model**
- Belongs to a user
- Stores metadata (user agent, IP address)
- Provides access to Google access token

**UserToken Model**
- Stores OAuth tokens (access token, refresh token) and expiration data
- Includes methods to check token expiration status
- Maintains token history with latest_first scope

#### Components

1. **OmniAuth Integration** (`config/initializers/omniauth.rb`):
   - Configures Google OAuth2 provider with scopes: email, profile, and drive.file
   - Sets access_type to "offline" for refresh tokens
   - Uses "consent" prompt for explicit user approval

2. **Authentication Concern** (`app/controllers/concerns/authentication.rb`):
   - Implements controller-agnostic authentication logic
   - Provides helper methods like `authenticated?`, `require_authentication`
   - Manages session lifecycle
   - Includes `allow_unauthenticated_access` class method for exceptions

3. **Sessions Controller** (`app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb`):
   - Handles OAuth callback
   - Creates/updates user records
   - Establishes user sessions
   - Manages logout

#### Authentication Flow

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. User approves permissions
3. Google redirects back with auth code
4. OmniAuth processes callback and creates auth hash
5. SessionsController creates/updates user record
6. New session is created and stored as HTTP-only, same-site cookie
7. User is redirected to application
8. Subsequent requests use session cookie for authentication

#### Security Features

- HTTP-only cookies prevent JavaScript access
- Same-site Lax cookies mitigate CSRF attacks
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Access tokens stored in database, not cookies
- Explicit OAuth consent

### Processing Abstraction System

Standardizes the workflow of collecting data, sending prompts, and processing responses.

#### Components

1. **ProcessingTask**
   - Encapsulates configuration for specific LLM task
   - Defines components for each processing step
   - Tracks metrics and processing time

```ruby
# app/services/processing_task.rb
class ProcessingTask
  attr_reader :processable, :process_type, :user, :configuration, :context
  attr_accessor :started_at, :completed_at, :error_message, :metrics

  VALID_PROCESS_TYPES = [
    "generate_rubric",
    "grade_student_work",
    "generate_summary_feedback"
  ].freeze
  
  def initialize(processable:, process_type:, user: nil, configuration:, context: {})
    @processable = processable
    @process_type = process_type
    @user = user
    @configuration = configuration.with_indifferent_access
    @context = context.with_indifferent_access
    @metrics = {}.with_indifferent_access
    validate!
  end
  
  # Configuration accessors
  def prompt_template
    configuration.prompt_template
  end
  
  def response_parser
    configuration.response_parser
  end
  
  def storage_service
    configuration.storage_service
  end
  
  def broadcaster
    configuration.broadcaster
  end
  
  def status_manager
    configuration.status_manager
  end
  
  # Timing methods
  def mark_started
    @started_at = Time.current
  end
  
  def mark_completed
    @completed_at = Time.current
  end
  
  def processing_time_ms
    return 0 unless started_at && completed_at
    ((completed_at - started_at) * 1000).to_i
  end
  
  def record_metric(key, value)
    @metrics[key] = value
  end

  private
  
  def validate!
    raise ArgumentError, "Processable is required" unless processable
    raise ArgumentError, "Process type is required" unless process_type
  end
end
```

2. **ProcessingPipeline**
   - Orchestrates entire processing workflow
   - Implements the 5-step pattern (collect, build, send, parse, store)
   - Handles errors and metrics collection

```ruby
# app/services/processing_pipeline.rb
class ProcessingPipeline
  def initialize(task)
    @task = task
    @logger = Rails.logger
  end
  
  def execute
    @logger.info("Starting processing pipeline for #{@task.process_type} on #{@task.processable.class.name}")
    
    @task.mark_started
    update_status(:processing)
    
    begin
      # Step 1: Collect data
      data = collect_data
      
      # Step 2: Build prompt
      prompt = build_prompt(data)
      
      # Step 3: Send to LLM
      response = send_to_llm(prompt)
      
      # Step 4: Parse response
      parsed_result = parse_response(response)
      
      # Step 5: Store result
      store_result(parsed_result)
      
      # Finalize
      @task.mark_completed
      @task.record_metric(:status, 'completed')
      @task.record_metric(:processing_time_ms, @task.processing_time_ms)
      
      # Record metrics to database
      save_processing_metrics(parsed_result)
      
      update_status(:completed)
      broadcast_update(:completed, parsed_result)
      
      ProcessingResult.new(success: true, data: parsed_result)
    rescue => e
      handle_error(e)
    end
  end
  
  private
  
  # Implementation of each processing step...
  # (methods omitted for brevity)
end
```

## Decision Log

### Assignment Form UX & Architecture Decisions (2025-04-21)

- **Field Structure:**
  - Using flat attributes (title, description, subject, grade level, instructions) matching the Assignment model
  - No nested attributes or form object at this stage due to simple flow

- **Rubric Selection:**
  - Toggle switch for "Generate with AI" (default) vs. "I have a rubric"
  - Textarea appears only when manual rubric is selected
  - Placeholder text: "Paste your rubric here, don't worry about formatting"

- **Google Picker:**
  - Integrated for selecting up to 35 student documents
  - Selected document data submitted as hidden field and handled in controller
  - Dedicated section for displaying selected documents

- **Feedback Tone:**
  - Slider bar instead of dropdown for selecting among three options:
    - Encouraging
    - Objective/Neutral
    - Critical
  - More engaging and intuitive UX than dropdown

- **Icon Usage:**
  - All icons rendered as Rails partials from `/icons` directory
  - Ensures maintainability and reusability

- **Form Model Rationale:**
  - Form object not used at this stage
  - Flat model approach sufficient for current requirements
  - Can introduce form/service object if complexity increases

- **Validation:**
  - Errors displayed at top of form
  - Following Tailwind and application style conventions

- **Submission:**
  - Form submits via POST
  - Stimulus controllers used for interactive elements
