# Task ID: 5
# Title: Build Processing Abstraction System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the processing abstraction system with ProcessingTask, ProcessingPipeline, and factory services.
# Details:
Create the ProcessingTask class as defined in the PRD to encapsulate configuration for specific LLM tasks. Implement the ProcessingPipeline class to orchestrate the 5-step workflow (collect, build, send, parse, store). Build factory services including ResponseParserFactory, StorageServiceFactory, BroadcasterFactory, and StatusManagerFactory. Implement support services such as DataCollectionService, PromptBuilder, and PromptTemplate. Create the necessary interfaces and base classes for parsers, storage services, broadcasters, and status managers. Set up the error handling and metrics collection within the pipeline.

# Test Strategy:
Test each component of the processing system in isolation. Verify the complete pipeline execution with mock services. Test error handling and recovery mechanisms. Ensure metrics are properly collected and recorded. Test factory services with different configurations.
