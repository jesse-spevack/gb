# Priority: high
# Description: Implement factory for creating status managers
# Details:
Create StatusManagerFactory class.
Implement manager creation based on process type.
Add configuration handling for manager initialization.
Implement default manager fallback.
Document supported manager types.
Add error handling for unsupported types.

Implementation completed with the following:
- Created StatusManagerFactory class with UnsupportedProcessTypeError
- Implemented manager creation for process types: "generate_rubric", "grade_student_work", "generate_summary_feedback"
- Added configuration handling with strict mode and config parameter
- Implemented DefaultStatusManager as fallback
- Documented supported manager types via supported_types() and supports?() methods
- Added proper error handling for unsupported types
- Created AssignmentStatusManager for assignment-level processing
- Created StudentWorkStatusManager for student work processing
- Added StatusUpdateBehavior module with shared functionality
- Ensured consistency with existing factory patterns in the codebase
- Implemented structured status update responses with metadata
- Added time estimation capabilities for assignment processing
- Provided support for both assignment and student work processable types

# Test Strategy:
Test manager creation for different process types.
Verify configuration handling.
Test default manager fallback.
Verify error handling for unsupported types.

Completed test coverage includes:
- Comprehensive test suite with 9 tests, all passing
- Verified integration with ProcessingPipeline (all tests pass)
- Confirmed consistency with existing factory patterns
- Tested creation of different manager types based on process type
- Verified proper handling of configuration parameters
- Tested default manager fallback functionality
- Verified error handling for unsupported types in strict mode
