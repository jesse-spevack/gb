# Title: Implement Assignment Summary and Processing Time Estimation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the assignment summary generation system and implement processing time estimation for better user experience.
# Details:
Implement the summary generation pipeline for class-wide insights. Create the parser for summary feedback items. Build UI components for displaying trends and recommendations. Implement the base time calculation for different processing tasks (rubric: 30s, student work: 60s, summary: 45s). Add dynamic adjustment for progress tracking and completion updates. Create UI elements for progress indicators, time remaining displays, and completion notifications. Implement the job to generate assignment summaries in the background.

# Test Strategy:
Test summary generation with various inputs. Verify the parsed output matches the expected structure. Test time estimation with different assignment sizes. Ensure progress tracking and time estimates update correctly. Test UI components for displaying progress and time estimates.
