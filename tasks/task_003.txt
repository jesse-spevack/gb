# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build Assignment Creation Form with Google Picker
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the assignment creation form with Google Picker integration for selecting student work documents.
# Details:
Create the AssignmentsController with new and create actions. Build the assignment form with fields for title, subject, grade level, and instructions. Implement a toggle for AI-generated vs custom rubric. Integrate Google Picker API for document selection (up to 35 documents). Create a Stimulus controller to handle the Google Picker integration. Implement the feedback tone selection slider with three options (encouraging, neutral, critical). Add validation for the form fields. Create the necessary views and partials following the UX decisions in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Test form submission with valid and invalid inputs. Mock Google Picker API for integration tests. Verify document selection limits. Test the toggle behavior for rubric selection. Ensure proper validation messages are displayed.
