# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Rubric Generation Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the rubric generation pipeline for creating structured rubrics from scratch or based on teacher guidelines.
# Details:
Create a specialized ProcessingTask configuration for rubric generation. Implement the custom prompt template for rubric creation. Build a response parser to convert LLM output to structured rubric data. Create the Rubric::CreationService for database record creation. Implement the job to process rubric generation in the background. Add the necessary UI components for displaying rubric criteria and levels. Implement the Rubric#to_prompt method for inclusion in subsequent prompts. Set up real-time updates for rubric generation progress.

# Test Strategy:
Test the rubric generation pipeline with various inputs. Verify the parsed output matches the expected structure. Test the database record creation with the parsed data. Ensure real-time updates are sent correctly. Test error handling and recovery for failed rubric generation.
