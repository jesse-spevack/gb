# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement LLM Integration System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the core LLM integration system with client architecture, resilience mechanisms, and cost tracking.
# Details:
Create the LLM::Client class as the entry point for LLM requests. Implement provider-specific clients for Anthropic and Google. Build the LLM::ClientFactory to create appropriate client instances. Implement resilience mechanisms including LLM::RetryHandler with exponential backoff and LLM::CircuitBreaker to prevent cascading failures. Create the LLM::CostCalculator to calculate costs based on token usage and LLM::CostTracker to record cost data to the database. Set up the necessary configuration for LLM providers. Ensure proper error handling and logging throughout the system.

# Test Strategy:
Test each LLM client with mock responses. Verify retry mechanism with forced failures. Test circuit breaker behavior under high failure rates. Validate cost calculation with known token counts. Test the entire request/response cycle with mocked external services.
