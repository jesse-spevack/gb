# Task ID: 8
# Title: Build Student Work Feedback Generation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the system for analyzing student work against assignment requirements and rubrics to generate detailed feedback.
# Details:
Create the document content retrieval service for Google Docs. Implement prompt construction combining student work, assignment, and rubric. Build the response parser to extract structured feedback from LLM responses. Set up progress tracking and real-time UI updates. Create the necessary UI components for reviewing and editing feedback. Implement the functionality to append feedback to Google Docs. Add retry mechanisms for failed processing. Create the job to process student work feedback in the background.

# Test Strategy:
Test document retrieval with mock Google API responses. Verify prompt construction with various inputs. Test response parsing with sample LLM outputs. Ensure progress tracking accurately reflects processing status. Test the feedback editing and Google Docs integration. Verify retry mechanisms work as expected.
