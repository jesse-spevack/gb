## Relevant Files

- `app/services/assignment_processor.rb` - Main orchestrator class that coordinates all three pipelines âœ“
- `test/services/assignment_processor_test.rb` - Unit tests for the AssignmentProcessor âœ“
- `app/jobs/assignment_job.rb` - Background job that invokes the AssignmentProcessor (existing, needs modification)
- `app/services/rubric_pipeline.rb` - Existing pipeline for rubric generation
- `app/services/student_work_feedback_pipeline.rb` - Existing pipeline for student feedback
- `app/services/assignment_summary_pipeline.rb` - Existing pipeline for assignment summary
- `app/services/broadcast_service.rb` - Existing service for broadcasting progress updates
- `app/services/status_manager_factory.rb` - Existing factory for managing assignment status
- `app/services/assignments/progress_calculator.rb` - Existing service for calculating progress
- `app/models/processing_metric.rb` - Existing model for tracking LLM call metrics

### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed in the `test` directory following the existing pattern
- Use `bin/rails test [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests
- The AssignmentProcessor will be invoked by the existing AssignmentJob, so integration testing will be important
- Follow TDD principles - write tests first, then implement to make them pass

## Implementation plan

### Task 1.1
**Write tests for AssignmentProcessor initialization**

Create `test/services/assignment_processor_test.rb` and write tests for:
- Initializing with a valid assignment ID
- Storing the assignment instance
- Raising error for invalid assignment ID
- Setting up instance variables for pipeline results

Testing strategy: Use minitest with fixtures for test data

### Task 1.2
**Implement AssignmentProcessor class initialization**

Create `app/services/assignment_processor.rb` with:
- Initialize method that accepts assignment_id
- Find and store the assignment record
- Initialize instance variables for tracking results
- Basic class structure following Rails conventions

### Task 1.3
**Write tests for process method interface**

Add tests for:
- Process method returns a result object
- Process method can be called without arguments
- Result object contains success status and data

### Task 1.4
**Implement process method skeleton**

Implement:
- Public `process` method
- Basic result structure
- Method stubs for private pipeline execution methods
- Ensure method returns appropriate result object

### Task 2.1
**Write tests for rubric pipeline execution**

- Results are collected for each student

### Task 2.4
**Implement student feedback pipeline execution**

Implement private method to:

- Process sequentially and collect results
- Build array of student contexts for summary

### Task 2.5

- "Creating assignment summary" message
- Correct assignment and channel parameters

### Task 3.2
**Implement pipeline-level progress broadcasting**

Add broadcasting calls:
- Before each pipeline execution
- Update student progress counter during iteration
- Use existing BroadcastService infrastructure
- Include appropriate progress messages

### Task 3.3
**Write tests for status updates**

Test that assignment status changes to:
- 'processing' when starting
- 'completed' on success
- 'failed' on critical failures
- Uses StatusManagerFactory correctly

### Task 3.4
**Implement status management**

Add status updates:
- Set initial processing status
- Update on major milestones
- Set final status based on results
- Use StatusManagerFactory for all updates

### Task 3.5

- Include in broadcast messages
- Ensure accurate percentage reporting

### Task 4.1
**Write tests for critical pipeline failures**

Test scenarios where:
- RubricPipeline fails (should stop processing)
- AssignmentSummaryPipeline fails (after successful student processing)
- Assignment is marked as failed in both cases
- Appropriate error messages are set

### Task 4.2
**Implement critical pipeline error handling**

Add error handling for:
- RubricPipeline failures (stop processing immediately)
- AssignmentSummaryPipeline failures (after collecting results)
- Set assignment status to failed
