## Relevant Files

- `app/models/level.rb` - Main Level model that needs point field and validations
- `test/models/level_test.rb` - Unit tests for Level model validations and functionality
- `db/migrate/[timestamp]_add_points_to_levels.rb` - Migration to add points field to levels table
- `app/models/assignment.rb` - Assignment model that will calculate criterion averages
- `test/models/assignment_test.rb` - Unit tests for assignment average calculations
- `app/views/assignments/show.html.erb` - Assignment show page to display criterion averages
- `app/controllers/assignments_controller.rb` - Controller to prepare average data for view
- `test/controllers/assignments_controller_test.rb` - Controller tests for average calculations
- `app/models/rubric.rb` - May need updates for level point assignment logic
- `test/models/rubric_test.rb` - Tests for rubric level point assignment
- `app/services/rubric/creation_service.rb` - Service that creates rubrics and levels
- `test/services/rubric/creation_service_test.rb` - Tests for automatic point assignment

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `my_class.rb` and `my_class_test.rb` in the `test` directory).
- Use `bin/rails test [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests.
