# Task ID: 47
# Title: Create BroadcasterFactory
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 44
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement factory for creating broadcasters
# Details:
Create BroadcasterFactory class following established factory patterns.
Implement broadcaster creation based on process type with three types: RubricBroadcaster, StudentWorkBroadcaster, and SummaryFeedbackBroadcaster.
Add configuration handling for broadcaster initialization.
Implement DefaultBroadcaster for fallback handling.
Create shared BroadcastBehavior module for DRY progress calculation logic.
Ensure all broadcasters respond to `broadcast(processable, status, data)` method.
Implement specific progress percentages for different statuses in each broadcaster type.
Add error handling with UnsupportedProcessTypeError for strict mode and graceful fallback otherwise.
Include configuration parameter for future enhancements.
Document supported broadcaster types with comprehensive YARD documentation and usage examples.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive test suite with 16 test cases covering all factory methods and edge cases.
Test broadcaster creation for different process types (RubricBroadcaster, StudentWorkBroadcaster, SummaryFeedbackBroadcaster).
Verify configuration handling and parameter passing.
Test DefaultBroadcaster fallback functionality.
Verify error handling for unsupported types in both strict and non-strict modes.
Test progress calculation logic for different statuses across broadcaster types.
Ensure all broadcasters properly implement the required interface.
Verify integration with the overall test suite to prevent regressions.
