# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Google OAuth2 Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the authentication system using Google OAuth2 to allow teachers to sign in with their Google accounts and access Google Docs.
# Details:
Create User, Session, and UserToken models according to the specifications. Implement OmniAuth integration with Google OAuth2 provider using the required scopes (email, profile, drive.file). Set up the SessionsController to handle OAuth callbacks, user creation/updates, and session management. Implement the Authentication concern with helper methods like authenticated?, require_authentication, etc. Ensure HTTP-only, same-site cookies for security. Set up necessary routes and views for the authentication flow.

# Test Strategy:
Write tests for authentication flow including sign-in, callback handling, and session creation. Test security features like HTTP-only cookies. Create fixtures for User, Session, and UserToken models. Test authentication helper methods in isolation.
