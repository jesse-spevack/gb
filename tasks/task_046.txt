# Task ID: 46
# Title: Create StorageServiceFactory
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 44
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement factory for creating storage services
# Details:
Create StorageServiceFactory class.
Implement service creation based on process type.
Add configuration handling for service initialization.
Implement default service fallback.
Document supported service types.
Add error handling for unsupported types.

Implementation completed with:
- StorageServiceFactory class following the same pattern as ResponseParserFactory
- Four storage service classes implemented:
  - RubricStorageService for "generate_rubric" process type
  - StudentWorkStorageService for "grade_student_work" process type
  - SummaryFeedbackStorageService for "generate_summary_feedback" process type
  - DefaultStorageService for unknown/fallback process types
- Full API compatibility with create(), supports?(), and supported_types() methods
- Strict mode support with UnsupportedProcessTypeError exception
- Configuration handling (reserved for future use)
- Consistent return format with metadata (stored_at, processable_id, etc.)
- Extensive YARD documentation with examples
- Clear TODO comments marking placeholder services for future implementation

# Test Strategy:
Test service creation for different process types.
Verify configuration handling.
Test default service fallback.
Verify error handling for unsupported types.

Testing completed with:
- 14 comprehensive unit tests in test/services/storage_service_factory_test.rb
- 5 integration tests in test/services/storage_service_factory_integration_test.rb
- Full compatibility with ProcessingTask and ProcessingTaskConfiguration
- Integration verified with ProcessingPipeline (9/9 tests passing)
- All 263 existing tests still passing
