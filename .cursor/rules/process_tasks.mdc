# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

## Task Implementation
- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say “yes” or "y"
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing the status from 🟡 pending to 🟢 completed.
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now 🟢 completed, also mark the **parent task** as completed by changing the status from 🟡 pending to 🟢 completed. 
- Stop after each sub‑task, summarize your work, and wait for the user’s go‑ahead. Your summary should include:
  1. A list of files created or modified
  2. A description of the changes made to each file
  3. Any implementation decisions made for each file

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed by changing the status from 🟡 pending to 🟢 completed per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the “Relevant Files” section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‑task** by changing the status from 🟡 pending to 🟢 completed.
   - Mark the **parent task** 🟢 completed once **all** its subtasks are 🟢 completed.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep “Relevant Files” accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.
