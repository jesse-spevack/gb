          <dd class="mt-2 text-base/7 text-gray-600">GradeBot delivers feedback that's indistinguishable from what you'd write yourself—only faster and more consistent across all students. You maintain complete control, reviewing and adjusting any suggestions before students see them. In our trials, teachers reported that GradeBot accurately matched their grading style in over 95% of cases.</dd>

          <dd class="mt-2 text-base/7 text-gray-600">We're teachers too, and we've seen the rise of AI-generated assignments. That's exactly why we built GradeBot to include AI detection technology that flags suspicious content for your review. Our detection tools are continuously updated to stay ahead of new AI writing methods—protecting your classroom's academic integrity while saving you hours of detective work.</dd>

          <dd class="mt-2 text-base/7 text-gray-600">Lots of teachers paste student work into ChatGPT. In fact, hearing about one such teacher inspired this product. GradeBot takes the workflow you might already be using and puts it into a tool that is easy to use and powerful.</dd>
