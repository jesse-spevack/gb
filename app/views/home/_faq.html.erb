          <dt id="faq-item-2" class="text-base/7 font-semibold text-gray-900">How long does it take to grade assignments?</dt>
          <dd class="mt-2 text-base/7 text-gray-600">Most assignments are graded within minutes. A typical class set of 30 5-page essays can be processed in well under an hour.</dd>

          <dt id="faq-item-3" class="text-base/7 font-semibold text-gray-900">Is my students' data secure?</dt>
          <dd class="mt-2 text-base/7 text-gray-600">Absolutely. We use industry-standard encryption and never store any student work or personally identifiable information. Everything comes from Google Drive and is not stored on our servers.</dd>

          <dd class="mt-2 text-base/7 text-gray-600">We share your concern that students might be using large language models (LLMs) to generate their work. That's why GradeBot runs checks that can help detect LLM generated work.</dd>

          <dt id="faq-item-6" class="text-base/7 font-semibold text-gray-900">I already use AI to grade my students' work, why should I give GradeBot a try?</dt>
          <dd class="mt-2 text-base/7 text-gray-600">Lots of teachers paste student work into ChatGPT. In fact, hearing about one such teacher inspired this product. GradeBot takes the workflow you might already be using and puts it into a tool that is easy to use and powerful.</dd>
