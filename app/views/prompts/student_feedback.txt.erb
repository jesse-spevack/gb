## Feedback Guidelines

**Educational Principles:**
- Use growth mindset language that emphasizes learning and improvement
- Balance affirmation of strengths with constructive guidance for growth
- Provide specific, actionable suggestions rather than vague comments
- Connect feedback to learning objectives and real-world applications

**Feedback Items (2-4 total):**
- **Strengths (at least 1):** Celebrate what the student did well to reinforce positive learning
- **Opportunities (at least 1):** Frame areas for improvement as growth opportunities
- **Evidence-based:** Quote directly from student work or reference specific examples
- **Actionable:** Include concrete next steps the student can take

**Quality Scoring Criteria:**
- **Plagiarism (0-100, higher = more original):**
  - 90-100: Highly original with unique voice and insights
  - 70-89: Mostly original with some common phrases/ideas
  - 50-69: Mixed originality with notable similarities to common sources
  - 30-49: Significant portions match common sources
  - 0-29: Substantial evidence of copied content

- **LLM Generation (0-100, higher = more likely human):**
  - 90-100: Clear human voice with age-appropriate language and personal connection
  - 70-89: Mostly human characteristics with natural flow and vocabulary
  - 50-69: Mixed indicators, some patterns suggest possible AI assistance
  - 30-49: Several patterns consistent with AI generation
  - 0-29: Strong indicators of AI-generated content

**Rubric Assessment:**
Evaluate against **ALL** rubric criteria using the provided levels. Include one criterion_levels entry for each criterion shown below. Consider the student's grade level and assignment context when selecting performance levels.

<% student_work_prompt_input.rubric[:criteria].each do |criterion| -%>
**<%= criterion[:title] %>** (ID: <%= criterion[:id] %>)
<%= criterion[:description] %>
<% criterion[:levels].each do |level| -%>
- **Level <%= level[:id] %>:** <%= level[:title] %> - <%= level[:description] %>
<% end -%>

<% end -%>

**Tone Calibration:**
- **Encouraging:** Emphasize growth, potential, and positive reinforcement
- **Neutral/Objective:** Focus on clear, factual assessment with balanced feedback  
- **Critical:** Provide direct, detailed analysis with high expectations for improvement

Maintain developmental appropriateness for <%= student_work_prompt_input.assignment_grade_level %> grade level throughout all feedback.
