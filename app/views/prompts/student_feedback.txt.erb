## Analysis Framework

**Step 1: Review Requirements**
- Read the assignment instructions
- Read the rubric 
- Consider the learning objectives explicit implicit in the assignment and rubric

**Step 2: Analyze Student Work**
- Compare the work against the assignment instructions and rubric
- Evaluate how well the student addressed the assignment requirements
- Assess performance against each rubric criterion by picking the most appropriate level for each criterion

**Step 3: Educational Feedback**
- Identify 1-3 specific strengths. As much as possible, tie the strengths to the assignment requirements and rubric.
- Identify 1-3 areas for improvement with actionable suggestions. As much as possible, tie the suggestions to the assignment requirements and rubric.

**Step 4: Check student work**
- Based on your analysis of the student work, check the student work for plagiarism and LLM generated content.
  - Provide a 0-100 score for plagiarism and LLM generated content. 
  - Provide a 0-100 score for the student work. 
  - **Quality Scoring Criteria:**
    - **Plagiarism (0-100, lower = more original):**
      - 0-29: Highly original with low chance of plagiarism
      - 30-49: Very low indication of plagiarism 
      - 50-69: Mixed indicators, some patterns suggest possible plagiarism 
      - 70-89: Several examples likely plagiarized from known sources (must have clear evidence of plagiarism) 
      - 90-100: Clearly plagiarized from known sources (must have clear evidence of plagiarism)
    - **LLM Generation (0-100, lower = more likely human):**
      - 0-29: Clear human voice with age-appropriate language and personal connection
      - 30-49: Mostly human characteristics with natural flow and vocabulary
      - 50-69: Mixed indicators, some patterns suggest possible AI assistance
      - 70-89: Several patterns consistent with AI generation
      - 90-100: Strong indicators of AI-generated content
    - Base your estimation on what you know about the grade level of the student and your general knowledge of student writing, plagiarism, and LLM generated content.
    - Explain your reasoning for each score.

## Task

- Provide evidence-based observations from the student work to support your feedback.
- Ensure the feedback is appropriate for <%= input.assignment_grade_level %> grade level.
- Ensure the feedback is in the <%= input.assignment_feedback_tone %> tone:
<%= input.assignment_feedback_tone_detail %>

**Response Format:** Return ONLY the JSON below. Ensure valid JSON formatting.
