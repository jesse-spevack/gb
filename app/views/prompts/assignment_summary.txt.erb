## Analysis Guidelines

Analyze the collective performance across all student works and provide comprehensive class-wide insights. Focus on patterns, trends, and actionable recommendations for instruction.

**Class Performance Overview:**
- Assess overall achievement relative to assignment expectations and <%= input.assignment_grade_level %> grade level standards
- Identify the range of performance levels across the class
- Note any surprising patterns or unexpected outcomes

**Pattern Recognition:**
- **Common Strengths:** Skills, concepts, or approaches that multiple students demonstrated effectively
- **Common Challenges:** Recurring difficulties, misconceptions, or areas where students struggled
- **Learning Indicators:** Evidence of student thinking processes, problem-solving approaches, or conceptual understanding

**Instructional Insights:**
- What the student work reveals about the effectiveness of prior instruction
- Specific concepts or skills that may need reteaching or reinforcement
- Successful instructional strategies evidenced by student performance
- Recommendations for future lesson planning and differentiation

**Rubric-Based Analysis:**
- Analyze the rubric performance summary for each criteria:
<% input.rubric_criteria.each do |criteria| %>
  - <%= criteria.title %>
<% end %>

**Feedback Items (2-4 total):**
- **Strengths (at least 1):** Celebrate patterns of success to reinforce effective teaching and learning
- **Opportunities (at least 1):** Identify class-wide areas for growth with specific instructional recommendations
- **Evidence-based:** Reference specific patterns or examples from multiple student works
